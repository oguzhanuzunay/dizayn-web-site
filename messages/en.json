As our company has been identified with the production and sale of pipes and pipe components over time, the Dizayn brand has been positioned as a pipe brand. As a result of Dizayn's identification with pipes and the importance we attach to specialization, our R&D company was given an independent structure under the name Mir R&D. Dizayn Group, Mir R&D company and our other subsidiaries were gathered under the roof of Mir Holding as of 2010. </p><p>Since its establishment, Dizayn Group, which has been producing firsts in Turkey, breaking world records, being the technology pioneer of its sector with dozens of patents that it has turned into industry, has become a world brand by exporting to more than 100 countries with its experience and high production power. With the investments it has realized in various parts of the world, it has set milestones to become a local brand of the important markets to which it takes its know-how, quality and principles.</p><p>Design Group, which aims for continuous development for the development of its country, the welfare of its stakeholders and to help those in need all over the world, expresses its gratitude to all its friends with whom it has walked a short or long road and continues to take steps to benefit humanity and the environment in order to “design” the coming years together.</p>",

This record is the first world record that Turkey has broken with an industrial product. Today, not even the first stage of this record has been reached in the entire world.</p><p>Developing special projects for the special products it produces, Dizayn Group has implemented many national and international giant projects with technological solutions whose patents belong to it. The Nile River Crossing Project, which brought water to the thirsty Sudanese people, is one of the best examples of this. The project was also met with great admiration by UNESCO and Dizayn Group won the grand prize at the Water Symposium held in France in 2003.</p><p>Dizayn Group has earned the right to participate in the World Final by winning both the Universal Contribution and First Place Awards in the Turkey Final of the World Young Entrepreneur Businessman Competition with the projects, products, patents it has, quality certificates and all its other works it has developed since its establishment. Dizayn Group Chairman of the Board of Directors İbrahim Mirmahmutoğulları successfully represented our country in the World Final held in the Philippines with the participation of 12 countries such as Germany, England and the Netherlands, and won the World Young Entrepreneur Businessman Competition Grand Prize. Dizayn Group, which was deemed worthy of an ‘AA’ grade by JCR Eurasia Rating, has taken the first step towards becoming a company that is ‘highly investable at an international level’. In the Innovation Awards competition organized by ISO in 2009, Dizayn Group was deemed worthy of the Grand Prize by receiving the highest score in each category. The 'Company of the Year' award was given to Dizayn Group in the 2009 TAÇED Traditional Service Awards Competition.</p>",
